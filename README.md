# Introduction 
TODO: Give a short introduction of the project. Let this section explain the objectives or the motivation behind this project. 

# Objectives
TODO: Provide individual and group learning goals, as well as the intended outcome of this project

# User Stories
TODO: Provide user requirements
    1. User Types (Student, other, etc)
    2. User Stories (As a [user], I want to [action] to achieve [result])
        
# System Architecure
TODO: List the tech stack and data flow. 

# Data Models
TODO: Provide examples of objects that may require schema. Things like user models, user settings, and static formatting may require schema.

# Algorithms and Data Structures
TODO: Describe how algorithms may be used in any of the many features this program will have. Graphs are likely, but other ADTs may be useful to us in this application. It is appropriate to include things we will use that are built into AWS.

# APIs and External Services
TODO: Search through Google APIs and the Microsoft Graph API to find the list of services we want to learn or use. Okta is also worth looking into, as well as Mongoose. The AWS Resources can also go here.

# Security Measures
TODO: Identify potential security issues such as storing personal data, location services, and network accessibility. Compare what will be handled by third party resources against the leftover features that require direct intervention.

#Testing Strategy
TODO: Detail the CI/CD pipeline and consider what types of test we want to run. Can we get away with just unit testing? Likely not because of the lack of schema our data will have. Funcitonal testing and integration testing will be our heavy hitters.

# Project Timeline
TODO: Naturally, this will take the duration of the semester. Give a time estimate of each Epic in weeks, which can then be turned into sprints.

# Appendices
TODO: If any information is left over, insert here.
